## üìã How to Use

### Using Claude Code Review

1. **Automatic Review**: Simply create a Pull Request - Claude will automatically review it
2. **Focus Areas**: Claude will focus on:
   - Financial calculation accuracy
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Performance optimization
   - Code maintainability
   - Python best practices

### Using Claude Code Workflow

#### Method 1: Manual Workflow Dispatch

1. Go to Actions ‚Üí Claude Code Workflow
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Fill in the task description
4. Select focus area
5. Optionally specify target files
6. Click "Run workflow"

#### Method 2: Issue-based Tasks

1. Create a new issue using the "Claude Code Task" template
2. Fill in the task details
3. Add the `claude-code` label
4. Claude will automatically process the task and create a PR

### Example Tasks

```yaml
# Performance optimization
Task: "Optimize the stock screening function to handle larger datasets more efficiently"
Focus: performance

# Security improvement  
Task: "Add input validation and sanitization for all user inputs in the stock analysis"
Focus: security

# Feature development
Task: "Add support for cryptocurrency analysis alongside stock analysis"
Focus: feature-development

# Bug fixing
Task: "Fix the debt-to-equity ratio calculation displaying incorrect values"
Focus: bug-fixing
```

## üõ† Configuration

### Claude Code Config (`.github/claude-code-config.yml`)

This file controls Claude's behavior:

```yaml
review:
  focus_areas:
    - security
    - performance  
    - financial_accuracy
  
  custom_instructions: |
    Focus on financial calculation accuracy and API error handling
```

### Issue Templates

Three templates are provided:
- **Claude Code Task**: Request automated coding tasks
- **Bug Report**: Report issues with focus on financial calculations
- **Feature Request**: Suggest new features with market scope

### Pull Request Template

Comprehensive template with:
- Change type classification
- Financial accuracy verification checklist
- Performance impact assessment
- Security considerations

## üîí Security Setup

### API Keys

1. **Anthropic API Key**: Get from https://console.anthropic.com
   - Add as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret
   - Required for Claude Code functionality

2. **Render Deploy Hook**: Get from your Render service settings
   - Add as `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` secret
   - Required for automatic deployments

### Permissions

The workflows require these permissions:
- `contents: write` - To create branches and commits
- `pull-requests: write` - To create and comment on PRs
- `issues: write` - To comment on issues

## üìä Monitoring and Artifacts

### Workflow Artifacts

Each workflow generates artifacts:
- **Code Analysis Reports**: Linting, security scan results  
- **Claude Task Outputs**: Detailed task execution logs
- **Deployment Logs**: Build and deployment information

### Notifications

Configure notifications for:
- Successful deployments
- Failed code reviews
- Security alerts
- Task completions

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Claude Tasks

1. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed task descriptions
2. **Set Context**: Include relevant background information
3. **Define Success**: Use clear acceptance criteria
4. **Review Results**: Always review Claude's changes before merging

### For Code Reviews

1. **Focus Areas**: Claude reviews focus on financial accuracy and security
2. **Manual Review**: Still perform manual reviews for business logic
3. **Test Changes**: Always test financial calculations manually
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation for significant changes

### For Deployments

1. **Test First**: Always test in development before merging to main
2. **Monitor**: Watch deployment logs for issues
3. **Rollback Plan**: Know how to rollback if needed
4. **Staging**: Consider using a staging environment

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow not triggering**:
   - Check if GitHub Actions are enabled
   - Verify the workflow file syntax
   - Check repository permissions

2. **Claude Code failing**:
   - Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set correctly
   - Check API quota and limits
   - Review workflow logs for specific errors

3. **Deployment issues**:
   - Verify `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` is correct
   - Check Render service status
   - Review deployment logs

### Getting Help

1. Check workflow run logs in the Actions tab
2. Review the artifacts for detailed error information
3. Create an issue using the provided templates
4. Check Claude Code documentation
